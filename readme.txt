Hi thank you for checking out my project. I will be working on this for a while and if you would like to either suggest changes or ask questions you can contact me at klanq_friend_of_prickly on discord and 
you can check out the game on itch io which im assuming where you found it from and my youtube here https://www.youtube.com/@HASGames-yl8jb/about for the game so you can get more updates to it. 
Not every script is well commented so i will work on that so incase anyone needs to look at it besides me.
